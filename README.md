# JavaScript Calculator

This is a basic calculator that adds, subtracts, multiplies, divides, and takes square roots.  The logic is written entirely in JavaScript.

## Description

I wanted to write a calculator that does what the user thinks it should, without the user thinking too hard.  It allows operations to be chained, and decides how to correctly handle order of operations.  The user can abort and change the current operation and iterate by repeatedly hitting `=`.  In other words, it acts like a normal calculator.
