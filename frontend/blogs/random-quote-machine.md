## Design Parameters

The task here is to request a quote from an online quotes API.  The quote needs to be randomly chosen, and an option must exist to post the quote to Twitter.

## Execution

The funniest source of online quotes I found was a collection of [short Chuck Norris stories](http://www.icndb.com).  Since he didn't really say them, I also needed a way to produce randomly generated author names, so I found a [source](http://uinames.com) and chose German sounding names.  Because, why not!
