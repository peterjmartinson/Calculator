TwitchTV Client
===============

#jQuery #AJAX #HTML

##Description
[TwitchTV](http://www.twitch.tv) streams live video of people playing video games.  The goal of this project is to see if specific players are streaming and, if so, to show what they're streaming and offer a link.  If a player doesn't exist, a message should be displayed that indicates such.

##Execution
I used [jQuery](LINK) to perform the AJAX call, but all DOM manipulation was done with plain old JavaScript.
