FCC Portfolio
=============

Do you find that the simplest projects sometimes take the longest?  Doesn't a "Local Weather" page sound so much more difficult than a "Portfolio" page?  For me, the most time consuming projects are those that involve visual design, and are relatively open ended.  Thus was the case with my Free Code Camp Portfolio page.

The mission is simple.  build a personal portfolio website with the following features:
1. I can access all of the portfolio webpage's content just by scrolling.
2. I can click different buttons that will take me to the portfolio creator's different social media pages.
3. I can see thumbnail images of different projects the portfolio creator has built (if you haven't built any websites before, use placeholders.)
4. I navigate to different sections of the webpage by clicking buttons in the navigation.

Instead of getting creative, I decided to try to clone an existing, awesome portfolio page.  Specifically, (Eina Onting's portfolio)[LINK] is clear, sharp, and inspiring).  Mine is a far cry from her polished product, but I'm happy I got even close.

Here are the two big things I learned while building this project.

## Responsive Design using Media Queries

Remembering the mantra "mobile first", I began the design as it should look on a mobile device.  

I wanted the design to be modular - I can stick all my projects into the page, and still have all the homepage trappings.
